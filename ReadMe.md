## Store

**Examples**

```javascript
// Add reducers to the Store
// When the reducer runs it will add the return value to the internal store under the key of the first
// argument, which is <people>.
// This will only run when the action's type property matches the 2 argument in this function, which is 'ADD'
// Make sure you return the default state on the case when there is nothing in the state. In this example we init
// to an array
  Store.registerReducer('people', 'ADD',(state = [], actions) => {
      // The actions come from the dispatcher.
      // Since this only runs when it matches you do not have to check the action's type or create switch statements
      return [...state, actions.myData];
  });

  Store.registerReducer(''people', 'DELETE',(state = [], actions) => {
      return [...state].filter((action, index) =>{
          return index != actions.index;
      });
  });


 // Create the store manager. You will be able to push changes to the store via Actions
 const manager  = new Store();


 // add a listener to the store to get updates every time a change is made.
 manager.subscribe(function(store){
      console.log(store)
  })


  // sends a message to the store to run the given event ('ADD' or 'DELETE') using myData
  // What you send is entirely up to you as well as what you want the event name (type) to be.
  manager.dispatch({type:'ADD', myData: {name: 'jerry'}});
  manager.dispatch({type:'ADD', myData: {name: 'michael'}});
  manager.dispatch({type:'ADD', myData: {name: 'kayla'}});
  manager.dispatch({type:'DELETE', index:1});
  // Ending value will be
  { people: [{name: 'jerry'}, {name: 'kayla'}] }
```

### subscribe

Add listeners to respond to changes in the data store.

**Parameters**

-   `cb` **[update_callback](#update_callback)** runs whenever the changes to the data store are completed

### dispatch

Runs an action or an array of actions.

**Parameters**

-   `actions`  
-   `actions-null` **([Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Action](#action)> | [Action](#action))** runs the dispatch function or array of dispatch functions
    for the given

### getExecutedActions

Returns all the actions that has been called.

Returns **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Action](#action)>** 

### enableCaching

Stores all of the actions in session storage.

**Parameters**

-   `shouldEnableCaching` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)**  if true, it activates the session storage.

### registerReducer

This will register a reducer. See <http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html> for details on Reducers.

The given reducer will fire only when the eventName matches a dispatched action type (or
actionKey).  The result from the reducer will be saved in the data store under the given propertyPath.
Note: Reducers still cannot mutate the data. Data should be immutable.

**Parameters**

-   `eventName` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)**  Custom(unique) event to associate with the action
-   `reducer` **[reducer](#reducer)** callback function that returns a non-mutated result.

### onBefore

### onComplete

Callback function that will execute after the store is updated

**Parameters**

-   `event` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** name of event to attach the callback

### shouldLoadFromCache

Uses the data from session storage to instantiate the store. Must have {enableCaching} set to true.

**Parameters**

-   `loadFromCache` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** if true, the store will instantiate using the data stored from the session
    storage

## Store

Creates a new data store. This is a singleton and will only create one store even if the constructor is
called more than once.

**Parameters**

-   `initialData`  data to initialize the store with
-   `options` **[store_prop](#store_prop)** see Store Options for more information

### subscribe

Add listeners to respond to changes in the data store.

**Parameters**

-   `cb` **[update_callback](#update_callback)** runs whenever the changes to the data store are completed

### dispatch

**Parameters**

-   `actions`  
-   `actions-null` **([Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Action](#action)> | [Action](#action))** runs the dispatch function or array of dispatch functions
    for the given

### getExecutedActions
